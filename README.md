# Dr. Driller

Dr. Driller is a clone of Mr. Driller, written in C++, making use of SDL 2.

The game supports local co-op multiplayer - a first for Mr. Driller-like games. 
(There is a 'Battle Mode' in Mr. Driller Drill Land, in which 2 - 4 players can play on one special map, seeing who can find a 'gold coin' first, it's not the same.)

## Controls
Left joycon controlls player 1, right controls player 1.
L/R = OK, +/- = START.
ANALOG = move, ZR/ZL = swap camera


Currently, the project is aimed at Nintendo Switch, although with a few changes it will run on other platforms. Multiple platforms are the goal.

This project is far from complete, and there are a number of bugs!


This project would not have been possible without adas's work on [Miss Driller](https://web.archive.org/web/20190321190556/http://www.geocities.co.jp/berkeley/2093/driller.html), in the year 2000.
Others built upon that to create [Drill2x](https://web.archive.org/web/20090207211032/http://wiki.gp2x.org/wiki/Drill2x) in around 2007.

A large refactor was done, upgrade to SDL 2, more Mr. Driller features were added (crystal blocks, white blocks, death clearing surrounding blocks, upgraded graphics, multiplayer, character selection...)

Namco has not created *real Mr. Driller game for more than 10 years, so Dr. Driller was started to fill the gap.
*real Mr. Driller game - something that is not a web-based slot machine (search online!), mutilated mobile version (Mr. Driller for Kakao), or some officially licensed web version that has different mechanics (can't find the link now)

There is a late 2009 trademark for 'Mr. Driller Encore', supposedly a port of Mr. Driller Drill Land to Switch, better late than never!
